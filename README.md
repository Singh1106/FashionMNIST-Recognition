# FashionMNIST-Recognition
FashionMNIST dataset recognition using pytorch.

As you will see that the GPU version is slower than the CPU version here as Loading the data into GPU is more expensive and it just takes more time here as its getting uploades for such small interval as my network is quite small.

All of my updates are on CPU version, i am not changing the original GPU version.

In latest CPU version, i have tried to resolve the Overfitting by adding a dropout layer, it doesnt seem to work here very efficiently, as the accuracy is almost same.

Give it a go.
